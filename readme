# Hey! Thanks for checking this code out, a couple of things to take in consideration:


1) The code was not completely written by me, actually, it was written mostly by someone else using the twitter api on  a blog post,
and I just adapted it to make sure the content was delivered in a csv format, both for extracting tweets based on a particular user handle, and tweets based on 
a particular hashtag. I donÂ´t know who the original owner was, so please tell if it was you, to give the proper credit. 

2) There are two files that need to be modified before use, the ones related to the twitter credentials: one in a .py file and one in a .json
make sure to add your credentials properly there. After that, run both files, and the rest of the respective function files should
work properly. 

3) The libraries and versions used, where the following: 

anaconda-client                    1.6.14   
anaconda-navigator                 1.9.6
